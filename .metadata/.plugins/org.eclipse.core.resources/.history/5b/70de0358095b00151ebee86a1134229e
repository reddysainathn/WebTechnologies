XML(Extensible Markup Language)
	XML palyes keyrole in Enterprise Messaging

	XML is designed to describe data,not to display data
	XML tags are predefined.You must define your own tags
	XML is designed to be self-descriptive.

	Mark-up language means it is full of tags,which we use to tag or mark the data
	XML is language and platform Independent.
	It is the universal way of representation
--------------------
DTD(Document Type Definition)
	
	When application sends data from app1 to app2 
	DTD defines the structure of and the legal elements and attributes of XML document.
---------------------
XML Schema Definition(XSD)
XSD also used to validate the DATA

Diff B/w XSD and DTD

XSD are more descriptive than DTD

-----------------------
To handle XML Data in JAVA is done by

What is a parser?
	Parser converts XML document to XMl Object

JAXP(JAVA API for XML Processing):Supported types are:::
	1.DOM(Document Object Model) parser 
	An XMl parser convets an XML document into an XML DOM object-which can then be manipulated with JAVA
	It provides an API to access the data in DOM

The XML DOM is:
	A standard object model for XML
	A standard programming interface for XML
platform and lang independent
A W3C Standard

The XML DOM defines the objects and 
properties of all XML elements and methods(interface) to access them.

Limitation of DOM:
	DOM is slow because,Dom always creates Document Object Model Tree.

	2.SAX(Simple API for XML) parser
	SAX parser is an Event Based Parser
	No additional objects are created here
	Whenever a parser comes across an element,it will consider as an event.

Advantages of SAX Parser:

	-No DOM  tree is created in SAX parser
	-SAX parser is fast than DOM parser
	

W3C means World Wide Web Consotium

JAXB(JAVA API for XML Binding)
	Is it advanced
	It will greatly simplyfy processing the XML data.
	No code will be written ,JAXB will tak care of it.
	->Unmarshaller
		XML-->Objects
	->Marshaller
		Objects-->XML
	Advanced API than JAXP	

Generating JAVA classes from .xsd file
 Right Click .xsd file and goto Generate-->JAXB Classes
	
Annotations are used to map with Schema definition in the generated Java Classes

JAXB Objects are created in ObjectFactory.

Why do we need XML in JAVA?

	XML plays keyrole in web services.
Sharing the data between two languages or frameworks is done by XML
XML is not Language or platform dependent

XML to interact in heterogeneous applications,we use XML
	

Difference between xsd and DTD

xsd's are more descriptive
